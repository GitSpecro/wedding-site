# Wedding Site

This is a wedding website which I built for my sister, containing pages, images, music, and custom styles.

## Project Structure

- **index.html** – Main landing HTML file for the website.
- **styles.css** – Custom styles used throughout the website.
- **pages/** – Additional pages for the site (details, RSVP, etc.).
- **scripts/** – JavaScript files to provide interactivity.
- **music/** – Audio file to optionally play music on the website.
- **images/** – Pictures used in the site (couple photos, gallery, venue, etc.).

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site locally.
3. Customize the content in the `/pages`, `/images`, `/music`, and `/scripts` folders as needed.

## Development

- Modify `styles.css` to update website styles.
- Add or edit HTML pages in the `/pages` directory for more content.
- Place additional images in the `/images` folder and reference them in your HTML as needed.
- Scripts (if any) should be placed in the `/scripts` folder.

## Usage

This site is static—no server backend required. All you need is a web browser.
